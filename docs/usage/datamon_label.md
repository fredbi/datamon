## datamon label

Commands to manage labels for a repo

### Synopsis

Commands to manage labels for a repo.

A label is a name given to a bundle, analogous to a tag in git.

Labels are a mapping type from human-readable strings to commit hashes.

There's one such map per repo, so in particular, setting a label or uploading a bundle
with a label that already exists overwrites the commit hash previously associated with the
label:  There can be at most one commit hash associated with a label.  Conversely,
multiple labels can refer to the same bundle via its commit hash (bundle ID).

### Examples

```
Latest
production
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for label
```
